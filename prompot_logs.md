# Prompt Logs

## Initial Prompts
- Build a CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard to monitor executions from tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- The dashboard should collect data, show real-time metrics, send alerts, and provide a frontend UI.
- Deliverables: Instructions/prompts, requirement analysis, tech design, source code, deployment, documentation.

## Decisions
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Database: SQLite (local dev)
- CI/CD Tool: GitHub Actions (local simulation)
- Alerting: Slack (Webhook)
- Frontend: React
- Containerization: Docker

## Next Steps
- Scaffold backend and frontend
- Implement core features (switched alerting from email to Slack)
- Add Dockerization and documentation
- Jenkins integration considered, but not required for demo. Design allows for future extensibility.
