# Requirement Analysis Document

## Project Overview
A CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard to monitor and visualize the health of GitHub Actions pipelines, providing real-time metrics and email alerts for failures.

## Key Features
- Collect pipeline execution data (success/failure, build time, status) from GitHub Actions (simulated locally)
- Real-time metrics: Success/Failure rate, Average build time, Last build status
- Email alerting on pipeline failures
- Frontend UI to visualize metrics and display logs/status of latest builds

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **Database:** SQLite (local development)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Alerting:** Email (SMTP)
- **Containerization:** Docker, docker-compose

## APIs/Tools Required
- GitHub Actions API (simulated or local data)
- FastAPI for backend API
- React for frontend
- SMTP for email alerting
- Docker for containerization

## Project Understanding
This dashboard simulates how modern engineering teams monitor CI/CD health using automation, observability, and actionable alerting. It is designed for local development and demonstration, with extensibility for production use.
